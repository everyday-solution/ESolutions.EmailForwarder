# ESolutions.EmailForwarder
Service to parse Eml-Files, pass them to a executable (like Virus- or Spam-Scanner) and forward the mails to a Smtp-Receiver. This can be used as a forefront security server for Smtp-Servers. This makes centralized scanning for multiple receivers possible. E.g. smal business email servers that can't afford their own scanning productes for each Smtp-Server.
